Itâ€™s also important to note that this is a REFERENCE demo meaning it is intended for you to
understand how you can use the extension; and cannot be played as is since it would need 
our personal .keystore file and our Google Services ID which cannot be included with the package.

After setting up your application use the "__macros__" script to quickly edit the leaderboard/achievement
references and start using this demo.
