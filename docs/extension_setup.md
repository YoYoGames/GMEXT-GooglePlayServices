# Setup

The Google Play Services extension is to be used alongside your Google Developer account ([web page](https://developers.google.com/)). All the required personal leaderboard ids and achievement ids should be managed from there.

> **:warning: IMPORTANT**
>
>  Before using this extension make sure to correctly set up your Android application following the steps on [this article](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004274212-Google-Play-Services-How-To-Use-This-In-Your-Games). It's also important to note that the demo provided with extension is a reference demo meaning it cannot be played as is, as it would need our `.keystore` and our Google Services ID which cannot be included with the package.

1. The extension setup will require the user to **double click** the extension asset in the asset browser and fill in the information regarding the GooglePlayServices account. <br>
