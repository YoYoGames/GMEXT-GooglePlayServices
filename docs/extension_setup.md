@title Extension Setup

# Setup

The Google Play Services extension is to be used alongside your Google Developer account ([web page](https://developers.google.com/)). All the required personal leaderboard IDs and achievement IDs should be managed from there.

> **:warning: IMPORTANT**
>
>  Before using this extension make sure to correctly set up your Android application following the steps listed on the ${page.google_setup} page. It's also important to note that the demo provided with the extension is a reference demo meaning it cannot be played as is, as it would need our `.keystore` and our Google Services ID which cannot be included with the package.

1. To set up the extension double-click the extension asset in the Asset Browser and fill in the application ID (see [this section of the developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/console/setup#avoid_common_issues) for where to find this): <br>

2. As the Google Developer Console layout might change in the future you can check their official guide on setting up leaderboards: [Adding Leaderboards](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/leaderboards#creating_a_leaderboard).

3. As the Google Developer Console layout might change in the future you can check their official guide on setting up achievements: [Adding Achievements](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/achievements#creating_an_achievement).
